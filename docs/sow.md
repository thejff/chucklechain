## **Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to develop a simple distributed ledger system that can initially handle generic data transactions and later be expanded to incorporate blockchain technologies and advanced functionalities. The system will be designed to understand the fundamentals of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and explore different programming languages.

## **Core Features**

### **1\. Data Structure**

- **Ledger**: Implement a ledger as a sequential list of entries, where each entry records a transaction.
- **Transactions**: Each transaction will include:
  - **Metadata**: Timestamp, transaction ID, and identifiers for participants.
  - **Payload**: Flexible data payload capable of carrying arbitrary data such as structured data (JSON), unstructured data (binary), etc.
  - **Public Key**: The sender’s public key to verify the transaction’s origin.
  - **Signature**: A digital signature created using the sender's private key.

### **2\. Transaction Handling**

- **Creating Transactions**: Create transactions with data payloads, sign them using private keys, and include the corresponding public key.
- **Broadcasting**: Implement a mechanism for broadcasting received transactions to all nodes in the network.
- **Verification**: Nodes receive transactions, verify digital signatures using the public keys, and validate transaction integrity.

### **3\. Network Interaction**

- **Node Communication**: Establish a basic peer-to-peer (P2P) network allowing nodes to exchange transactions and synchronization data.
- **Initial Sync and Regular Sync Checks**: Facilitate new nodes syncing up with the network by downloading the existing ledger from peer nodes and regularly check ledger integrity across the network.

### **4\. Consensus Algorithm**

- **Basic Consensus Mechanism**: Implement a simple consensus mechanism, such as requiring a majority of nodes to acknowledge a transaction before it is added to the ledger.

### **5\. Security**

- **Public Key Infrastructure**: Use cryptographic techniques to manage public keys and verify transaction signatures.
- **Security Protocols**: Include mechanisms for key management, including revocation and updating keys if compromised.

## **Expansion Capabilities**

### **1\. Blockchain Technology**

- **Blocks and Blockchain**: Upgrade the ledger to use blocks containing multiple transactions linked via cryptographic hashes to form a blockchain.
- **Enhanced Consensus Algorithms**: Introduce advanced consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and the Raft algorithm.

### **2\. Smart Contracts and Complex Applications**

- **Scripting and Smart Contracts**: Implement a simple scripting language for smart contracts that can interact with and manipulate the stored data payloads.
- **Query Capabilities**: Develop functionalities to efficiently query the ledger based on transaction attributes and payload content.

### **3\. Testing and Documentation**

- **Testing Framework**: Create a comprehensive testing framework for individual components and the entire system to ensure functionality and robustness.
- **Documentation**: Provide detailed developer and API documentation to aid understanding and facilitate contributions to the project.

### **4\. User Interface**

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Develop a CLI for interacting with the ledger, initiating transactions, and viewing the ledger state.

## **Implementation Notes**

- **Modular Design**: Ensure the software is modular to easily introduce new features.
- **Technology Choice**: Start with a single programming language and later extend the system across multiple languages to compare their capabilities.

## **Conclusion**

This SoW provides a structured pathway to developing a distributed ledger that meets initial learning objectives while laying the groundwork for future expansions into more complex DLT systems.
