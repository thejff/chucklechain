# ChuckleChain
The Main ChuckleChain Repo - ChuckleChain is a toy Distributed Ledger Specification designed with the intention of using it to learn new languages and to learn more about, and experiment with, Distribute Ledger Technology.

The intention for this repo is that it contains the required documentation to implement ChuckleChain, as well as links to the various implementations of it.
